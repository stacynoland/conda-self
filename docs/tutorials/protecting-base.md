# Protecting your base environment

This tutorial walks through setting up base environment protection
from scratch and understanding what happens at each step.

## Before you start

Verify conda-self is available (install with `conda install -n base conda-self`):

```bash
conda self --version
```

## Check current status

First, see if base is already protected with [conda doctor](inv:conda:std:doc#commands/doctor):

```bash
conda doctor base-protection
```

If base is not protected, you will see a message indicating that the
health check found an issue.

## Enable protection

Run the fix:

```bash
conda doctor base-protection --fix
```

You will be prompted to confirm. Here is what happens:

### Step 1: Clone base to default

Your current base environment is cloned to a new environment called
`default`. All packages, including pip-installed ones, are preserved
in the clone. This is your fallback -- you can activate `default`
and continue working as before.

```bash
conda activate default
```

### Step 2: Save a snapshot

A snapshot of base is saved in `@EXPLICIT` format to
`conda-meta/base-protection-state.explicit.txt`. This file lists
every package URL in the environment before the reset, enabling
exact restoration later.

### Step 3: Reset base

Base is stripped down to conda, its registered [plugins](inv:conda:std:doc#dev-guide/plugins/index), and their
dependencies. Everything else is removed.

### Step 4: Freeze base

A freeze file is written to base, preventing regular [conda install](inv:conda:std:doc#commands/install)
from modifying it. Only `conda self` commands (which pass
`--override-frozen`) can make changes.

## Verify protection

Run the health check again:

```bash
conda doctor base-protection
```

It should now report that base is protected.

Try installing a regular package into base:

```bash
conda install -n base numpy
```

This will fail with a frozen environment error. That is the expected
behavior.

## Use the default environment

Your previous packages are in the `default` environment:

```bash
conda activate default
python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
```

## Non-conda packages

If your base environment contains pip-installed packages, you will
see a warning before protection proceeds:

> Warning: Base environment contains N non-conda package(s) that
> will become non-functional after reset. They are preserved in the
> cloned 'default' environment.

These packages are copied to `default` but will not work in the
reset base. Reinstall them in `default` or another environment
if needed.
